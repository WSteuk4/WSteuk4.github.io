    <h1>Blog #2: Chapter 2, A Pragmatic Approach</h1>
        <p>This blog post was written for homework #2 for CSCI 260.
        Here, I will give my thoughts on chapter 2 of the textbook and will
        discuss the upcoming project.</p>

        <p>To begin this post, there were several aspects of Chapter 2 of The Pragmatic Programmer:
        From Journeyman to Master that stood out to me.  The two sections that I most enjoyed
        dealt with topics involving duplication in programming and estimating time until
        completion in software engineering projects.</p>

        <p>Duplication is an idea that I have never thought of in regard to software.
            Obviously, it is important to ensure that code is written in its simplest
            form to ensure better performance, however, being mindful of duplication
            goes further.  The text provides many examples of having to go back and change
            various parts of code for any number of maintenance reasons.  If there is
            duplication across a system, one must go back and make changes in multiple places.
            Here there is great room for error: “It isn’t a question of whether you’ll remember:
            it’s a question of when you’ll forget.”  I realized that designing code that allows
            for changes to be made in a single place is critical for performance and for the
            long-term success of a program.  The text furthers the idea of duplication by
            discussing the various types.  The most difficult form of duplication to detect is
            inter-developer duplication.  For example, developers on a team may develop
            duplicated processes that will go unnoticed for years (the book gives examples
            of Y2K compliance in social security validation).  In this case, I learned more
            about how critical communication is when working on a team with other developers.
            Everyone must have an understanding as to what they are working on and what everyone
            else is working on in order to prevent duplication and other errors. </p>

        <p>The last section of this chapter discusses project time estimation.  This
            is another topic that I have never really put much thought into regarding
            software development.  As a student, we are told when our projects are to be
            finished; we are never asked to determine how much time they will take us to
            complete.  Upon realizing this, I thought about how critical it is in a business
            setting to be able to create realistic deadlines for development projects.  The
            text suggests breaking the project into components and evaluating each component
            individually, keeping in mind factors such as resource availability and team members.
            It is also suggested to keep a log of how close one was to hitting a targeted deadline
            so that deadlines in the future will be better crafted.  Again, communication is
            critical when estimating the duration of a project and possible issues that may add
        more time must be identified as early as possible.</p>

        <p>For the final part of this post, I wanted to discuss the “Jobs” project
            page on Trello.  I am very excited about working on this project and had
            a few ideas about other stories that may be useful to add.  I have joined
            the page and viewed the existing stories.  First, if the job prospect is
            adding their own skills and certifications into the program, it may be
            beneficial to automatically generate a list of “suggested jobs” based on
            these skills.  If the program automatically picks jobs that a job-seeker
            would be most likely to match with, we have made the job of the administrator
            easier and the job-seeker will not have to spend as much time searching.
            Additionally, I did not see anything about notifications on the Trello page.
            Perhaps the user can receive email notifications of their suggested jobs,
            interviews, and other updates.  I believe that these features would make the
        job board website easier to use for administrators and job-seekers. </p>
