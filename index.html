    <h1>Page Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Will Steuk and this page was
      created as a part of my CSCI 260 class.</p>


    <h2>Blog Post 1: Homework #1</h2>
     <p>As I read Chapter 1 of "The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master", I was very surprised by the contents
     of the chapter.  The text and messages in the chapter were far different from any computer science book that I have read before.
     Instead of discussing actual code, I was surprised to find lessons and real-world examples involving software development in the workplace.
     Before my CSCI 260 class, my computer science classes have not spent much time relating the material to situations in the
     professional world.  Chapter 1 of this semester's text book did.  While there were several sections of the chapter that were
     especially meaningful for me, one stood out in particular.</p>

     <p>Section 3 of the chapter, titled "Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs" stood out to me the most.  In this section of the chapter
     three hungry soldiers motivate villagers into bringing them various ingredients for a soup by starting with, meerly, a pot of
     boiling water containing a few stones.  As the curious villagers bring more and more ingredients, the soldiers cook and make
     a delicious soup that everyone shares.  Upon reading this story, I was very confused as to the relation between the soldiers, soup, and
     software engineering.  However, some thought of my own and further reading of the text made it clear.  The soldiers serve as a
     cataylst in the situation.  Their leadership brings out curiosity, excitement, and a desire to produce a finished product of
     high quality in the villagers.  With the soldiers' guidence the villagers are able to come together to create soemthing that they
     could not have created by themselves.  The text relates this to the topics of this class.  Sometimes, when one understands what must
     be done to complete a project, and has a vision for how to do it, they may receive various pushbacks that normally accompany an innovative
     project in its early stages.  However, by starting with something within reason, and by developing it strongly, one may show people a product
     that will excite and inspire them.  They will make suggestions and will rally around the project with their own contributions.  Start with the
     stones to inspire a team, and create something extravagent by gaining the support and contributions of a motivated team.  This can be directly related
     to developing software products today.</p>

     <p>This part of the chapter was inspring to me for a number of reasons.  I have always strived to be a leader when the situation presents itself,
     whether in school, work, or internships.  I have found that rallying a team behind an idea that is unique is often very challenging.  People
     generally like to keep to the status quo.  A new idea may come with a certain degree of risk that will make certain individuals uneasy.
     When I look to rally people behind a idea, project, or product, I will now turn to the lessons from the text mentioned above.  I will start
     with what is within reason.  I will develop the starting block of a project that can serve as an inspiration to people.  I will look for others
     to make suggestions and to offer contributions once they see the vision, understand it, and realize its possibility.  I believe that this will
     allow me to create innovative technical products throughout my career.  </p>
